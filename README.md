# 8086
Experiments with 8086 assembly for DOS. Hopefully this'll all culminate in a fully fledged game, but we'll have to see how that turns out! Starting off with the basics, and slowly moving up to more advanced things.

Compile these with NASM using the following command:
```nasm -f bin -o file.com file.asm```
