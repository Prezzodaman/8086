Absurdity
It's an adventure involving a bald-headed version of the creator who's obsessed with Nerf guns wheeling around a like-minded gun wielding bosnian ape who team up together to perform theft on the local supermarket in an attempt to finalize their collaborative gun collection.

Irony
The employees of the shop are also cimiting chrime, harrassing Phenice and Bosnian Ape by way of bomb throwing and counter-attacks via actual guns.

Replayability
The game slowly gets harder, with different employees appearing more frequently, and their level of attack increasing.
